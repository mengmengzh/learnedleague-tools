# learnedleague-tools

Experimental repo for [Learned League](http://www.learnedleague.com) related tools. Currently has an extension to add best money data to 1DS results.

### Installing

Unpack all files somewhere and follow instructions at
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted for loading a development
Chrome extension. The extension is also available now on the Chrome web store
as well as a signed XPI on the [releases](https://github.com/mengmengzh/learnedleague-tools/releases) page.

### Caveats

The extension is very dependent on the specific way LL results pages are coded right now.
